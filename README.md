# gpio-example

This repository contains some code examples for the Linux GPIO chardev API and libgpiod.

The scripts have been tested on Fedora 37 in combination with the shipped python 3.11 distribution. The dependencies can be installed as follows:

```bash
dnf install python3-libgpiod python3-Automat python3-notify2
```
